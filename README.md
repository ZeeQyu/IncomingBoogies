One-week project with a three-man team

A designer in my game development school created a game concept for a small game, which I found interesting.
I decided to make a quick implementation of it in unity, and pulled in a graphics artist to make it look not horrible.
This is the result of that week of work.

To play, press "Clone or download" -> "Download zip", unzip the archive anywhere and then run the exe file inside.

Aim with the mouse, hold down the mouse button to shoot, hit the enemies to survive and live for as long as possible.

Design: Spooken
Art: Larpan
